------Character change midsong------

1- Move the "Play As Opponent.lua" script to a custom_events folder (for example: "mods/YOURMOD/custom_events") [create that folder if it doesn't exist]
2- Make a new lua file (with any name) at any script folder (global or in a song) or use any other script/event and add this to it:

function onBeatHit()
	
	--this will enable opponent play when the beat is the 20th beat of the song
	if curBeat == 20 then
		removeLuaScript("custom_events/Play As Opponent")
		addLuaScript("custom_events/Play As Opponent")
	end
	
	--this will disable the opponent play
	if curBeat == 50 then
		removeLuaScript("custom_events/Play As Opponent")
		
		--if you missed the colors should be back to normal
		setProperty('dad.colorTransform.redMultiplier', 1)
		setProperty('dad.colorTransform.greenMultiplier', 1)
		setProperty('dad.colorTransform.blueMultiplier', 1)

		--for notes that were changed for the script to work
		for i = 0, getProperty('notes.length')-1 do
		
			if not (getPropertyFromGroup('notes', i, 'rating') == 'ignore') then
				setPropertyFromGroup('notes', i, 'ignoreNote', false)
			end
			
		end
		
		--this is to add the input back 
		runHaxeCode([[
			game.keysArray = [
				ClientPrefs.copyKey(ClientPrefs.keyBinds.get('note_left')),
				ClientPrefs.copyKey(ClientPrefs.keyBinds.get('note_down')),
				ClientPrefs.copyKey(ClientPrefs.keyBinds.get('note_up')),
				ClientPrefs.copyKey(ClientPrefs.keyBinds.get('note_right'))
			];
			game.controlArray = [
				'NOTE_LEFT',
				'NOTE_DOWN',
				'NOTE_UP',
				'NOTE_RIGHT'
			];
		]])
	end
	
end

(obviously change 20 and 50 with any number you want and change the script howewer you want for your mod, and maybe add a warning or something as well)

3- Should be good to go! Now when you go to the song and you wait a bit it should change you to the opponent and then turn you back to boyfriend





------Character change with custom difficulty------

1- Move the "Play As Opponent.lua" script to a custom_events folder (for example: "mods/YOURMOD/custom_events") [create that folder if it doesn't exist]
2- Make a new lua file (with any name) at any script folder (global or in a song) or use any other script/event and add this to it:

function onCreate()
	
	if difficultyName:lower() == 'NAMEHERE' then
		addLuaScript("custom_events/Play As Opponent")
	end
	
end

(change NAMEHERE with the difficulty you want to only have opponent play, in lowercase)

3- Done! When you go to the song and with the difficulty you've chosen you should be playing as the opponent





------Character change with keys------

1- Move the "Play As Opponent.lua" script to a custom_events folder (for example: "mods/YOURMOD/custom_events") [create that folder if it doesn't exist]
2- Make a new lua file (with any name) at any script folder (global or in a song) or use any other script/event and add this to it:

function onUpdate()
	
	if getPropertyFromClass('flixel.FlxG', 'keys.justPressed.Q') then
		removeLuaScript("custom_events/Play As Opponent")
		addLuaScript("custom_events/Play As Opponent")
	end
	
	if getPropertyFromClass('flixel.FlxG', 'keys.justPressed.E') then
		removeLuaScript("custom_events/Play As Opponent")
		
		--if you missed the colors should be back to normal
		setProperty('dad.colorTransform.redMultiplier', 1)
		setProperty('dad.colorTransform.greenMultiplier', 1)
		setProperty('dad.colorTransform.blueMultiplier', 1)

		--for notes that were changed for the script to work
		for i = 0, getProperty('notes.length')-1 do
		
			if not (getPropertyFromGroup('notes', i, 'rating') == 'ignore') then
				setPropertyFromGroup('notes', i, 'ignoreNote', false)
			end
			
		end
		
		--this is to add the input back 
		runHaxeCode([[
			game.keysArray = [
				ClientPrefs.copyKey(ClientPrefs.keyBinds.get('note_left')),
				ClientPrefs.copyKey(ClientPrefs.keyBinds.get('note_down')),
				ClientPrefs.copyKey(ClientPrefs.keyBinds.get('note_up')),
				ClientPrefs.copyKey(ClientPrefs.keyBinds.get('note_right'))
			];
			game.controlArray = [
				'NOTE_LEFT',
				'NOTE_DOWN',
				'NOTE_UP',
				'NOTE_RIGHT'
			];
		]])
	end
	
end

3- Should be good to go! Now go to any song and press the Q and E keys to change between opponent and boyfriend (Q is opponent, E is boyfriend)
